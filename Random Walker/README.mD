RandomWalker.java simulates the motion of a random walker for N steps and then squares the distance walked. This is represented as graph coordinates starting from the origin (java RandomWalker N).N is number of steps.

RandomWalkers.java simulates the distance randomly walked and outputs the average distance based on how many trials were inputted (java RandomWalkers N T). N is number of steps and T is the amount of cycles taken with N steps.
